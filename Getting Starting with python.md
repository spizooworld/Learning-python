**Lesson 01 - Getting Started With Python**

**Introduction to Python**

Python (British pronunciation: /ˈpaɪθən/; American pronunciation: /ˈpaɪθɑːn/) is a programming language invented by Dutch programmer **Guido van Rossum**. It is currently one of the most popular programming languages in the world and has one of the largest user communities.

Python emphasizes **code readability** and **a very clean syntax**. Compared with languages such as C or Java, Python allows developers to express ideas with **far fewer lines of code.**

Below is Python’s ranking from an authoritative programming language index — the **TIOBE Index**, which evaluates language popularity based on worldwide usage.

According to the latest TIOBE data (2024–2025), **Python ranks #1 worldwide**, showing continuous growth in popularity.

**Python Timeline (History of Python)**

1. December 1989 — The Birth of Python
Guido van Rossum decided to develop a new scripting language and its interpreter during a boring Christmas vacation.
The language was intended to be a successor to the ABC language and replace Unix shell scripts and system-level C programs.
Since Guido was a devoted fan of the BBC TV show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, he chose the name Python.

2. February 1991 — Python 0.9.0 Released
Guido posted the first version of the Python interpreter in the alt.sources newsgroup, marked as version 0.9.0.

3. January 1994 — Python 1.0 Released
Python 1.0 was released — this is where the journey truly began.

4. October 2000 — Python 2.0 Released
The entire development process became more transparent, and the ecosystem slowly started forming.

5. December 2008 — Python 3.0 Released
Python 3.0 introduced many modern programming language features,
but it was not fully backward-compatible with Python 2.

6. April 2011 — pip Released
pip was released, giving Python its own package management tool.

7. July 2018 — Guido Steps Down
Guido van Rossum announced that he would take a “permanent vacation” from his role as the
BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) — the person with final decision authority during community disputes.

8. January 2020 — Python 2 Support Ends
After 11 years of Python 2 and Python 3 coexisting,
official updates and maintenance for Python 2 were stopped.
Users were requested to switch to Python 3.
> **Note:**  
> Most software version numbers are generally divided into three parts, in the format **A.B.C**.  
> - **A** represents a major version. When the software undergoes a complete rewrite or introduces a change that is not backward-compatible, A increases.  
> - **B** represents a feature update. B increases when new features are added.
> - **C** represents a minor change (for example: fixing a Bug). Any modification increases C.

**Python Advantages and Disadvantages**

**Advantages of Python**

Python has many advantages. Here are a few:

- Simple and elegant — compared to many other programming languages, Python is easier to learn.

- You can do more with fewer lines of code, improving development efficiency.

- Open-source, with a strong community and ecosystem.

- Very versatile — it can be used for many different purposes.

- Works as a “glue language” — can integrate programs written in other languages.

- Interpreted language — easier to run across multiple platforms and operating systems.

**Disadvantages of Python**

- The main disadvantage of Python is its low execution efficiency (a common issue with interpreted languages).
If execution speed is a priority, languages like C, C++ or Go may be a better choice.

**Application Areas of Python**

Today, Python is widely used in desktop application development, web server development, cloud infrastructure development, web data scraping, data analysis, quantitative trading, machine learning, automation, and many other fields.

Many major tech companies use Python to build internal support systems, perform automated testing, and automate operations and maintenance tasks.

Many companies also use Python for big data processing — from data collection and data cleaning to final data visualization — Python provides complete solutions and helps businesses extract commercial value from data.

In addition, traders working in quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, tend to use Python to connect to trading systems and write trading strategies.
